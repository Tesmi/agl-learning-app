**************UPLOAD COURSE WINDOW*******************

**> Initial landing screen for student would be a collection of cards which have subject name and number of files 
**> After clicking on any of the cards student will be greated with all the pdf files for that course and also would be able to download all of them 
**> It will be centralized for all the students, meaning all the data will be serving from one collection of mondodb, except for pdfs they will be hosted from s3 bucket.
**> On the download screen of every course a student can also comment (will be a bit tricky so keep it simple).
**> On the teacher's screen, uploading a course requires him to 
	1. Write name of the subject
	2. choose multiple pdf files 
	3. select class 

**> use 
	const { exec } = require('child_process');
	
	exec('find . -type f | wc -l', (err, stdout, stderr) => {
	if (err) {
	console.error(`exec error: ${err}`);
	return;
	}
	
	console.log(`Number of files ${stdout}`);
	});
